<H5>Comdata's Commitment to Privacy</H5>
<p align="justify">Your privacy is important to Comdata. To 
better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online 
information practices. To make this policy easier to read, we use the term 
"Comdata's Web Site" to include <A 
href="http://www.comdata.com/">comdata.com</A>, <A 
href="http://www.iconnectdata.com/">iconnectdata.com</A>, <A 
href="http://www.gocomchek.com/">gocomchek.com</A>and 
<A href="http://www.storedvalue.com/">storedvalue.com</A>. This policy does not 
apply to web sites that may be accessed through links from Comdata's Web Site, 
such as companies who may advertise on Comdata's Web Site. This policy applies 
to personal information that may be collected by or submitted to Comdata through 
its Web Site. Comdata maintains an additional policy for information submitted 
to Comdata in methods other than through Comdata's Web Site. A copy of that 
policy can be obtained by calling 1-800-741-3939, ext. 7627. </p>
<H5>Who We Are</H5>

<p align="justify">Comdata Network, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ceridian 
Corporation ("Comdata"), provides credit and debit processing and reporting for 
commercial fleets and merchants, support services for commercial fleets, SVS 
electronic cash, gift and chip card programs for retailers and governmental 
agencies, Comchek eCash funds distribution services for retail and other 
industries, and point-of-sale equipment for travel plazas and convenience 
stores. </p>
<H5>Collecting Your Information</H5>
<p align="justify">The majority of the information that is 
collected by or submitted to Comdata is information related to a commercial or 
business entity, not to individual consumers. However, in some instances, it may 
be necessary for a consumer to submit consumer information to Comdata or for 
Comdata to collect that information. "Consumer Information" is information which 
is personally identifiable information about a consumer and may include your 
name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, account number, card 
holder identification number or other information that could be used to identify 
you. </p>
<H5>Automatically Collected Information</H5>

<p align="justify">Comdata will collect no Consumer 
Information about you when you visit Comdata's Web Site unless you choose to 
provide that information to us. If you visit Comdata's Web Site and do nothing 
more than browse the site, read pages, or download information, Comdata will 
gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This 
information does not identify you personally. Comdata collects and stores 
indefinitely your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, as well as information about 
the date and time of your visit, whether a file you have requested exists, and 
how many "bytes" of information were transmitted to you over the web from this 
site. An "Internet Protocol Address" or "IP Address" is a series of numbers that 
identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. It does not 
identify you personally. Comdata may use your IP address to assess the frequency 
of visits to its Web Site and the popularity of its various pages and functions. 
Comdata does not attempt to match any personally identifiable information that 
you provide to us with your IP address. <BR></BR>Comdata may use "cookies" to 
keep track of login name and password and/or to tailor its web contents to its 
users' interests. Cookies are files that a web site can place on your computer. 
A cookie file allows the web site to recognize you as you click through pages on 
the site and when you later revisit the site. A web site can use cookies to 
"remember" your preferences, and to record your browsing behavior on the web. 
Although you can prevent web sites from placing cookies on your computer by 
using your browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability 
to view or interact with some web sites, including Comdata's Web Site. </p>

<H5>Voluntarily Provided Information</H5>
<p align="justify">Comdata's Web Site collects information 
from you only if you choose to voluntarily provide that information to Comdata. 
In a few areas of Comdata's Web Site, Comdata may ask you to provide information 
that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain 
information, materials and services available from Comdata's Web Site. It is 
optional for you to participate in these sites. However, failure to participate 
may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and 
services. The information Comdata may ask you to provide is meant to be 
information relative to a commercial entity. However, from time to time, it may 
be necessary for you to submit Consumer Information in addition or in 
substitution of certain commercial information. <BR></BR>Comdata may request 
information from you when you: 1. Log-on certain areas of Comdata's Web Site 
such as iconnectdata.com where you may be prompted to provide your Comdata login 
and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials 
or services 2. Register or sign up to receive a service such as the service 
offered on www.iconnectdata.com 3. Participate in a sweepstakes or other 
promotion offer 4. Request information from Comdata on a "contact us" form 
5.Provide feedback in an online survey or through a "site feed back" form 
<BR></BR>Comdata may use the information submitted in this manner to respond to 
your requests. Comdata does not collect any Consumer Information from any of the 
above for any purpose other than to respond to your needs. 
</p>
<H5>Dissemination of Your Information</H5>

<p align="justify">Comdata does not sell or in any way 
share any Consumer Information collected through its Web Site with any third 
party. The information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed only to 
Comdata employees or officials with a "need to know" for purposes of fulfilling 
their job responsibilities. Comdata requires its employees or officials who have 
access to Consumer Information to protect it and keep it confidential. 
Circumstances may arise in which Comdata may be required to disclose your 
Consumer Information to a third party, such as, with a corporate divestiture or 
dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including 
our associated customer lists which may contain Consumer Information), or if 
disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government 
investigations or proceedings. </p>

<H5>Use of Information for Marketing Purposes</H5>
<p align="justify">Some areas of Comdata's Web 
Site may offer users the option to receive marketing information from Comdata 
such as information on new products and services. If you do not want to receive 
such information, simply "uncheck" the box that states you agree to receive such 
materials. If the box remains checked, you will automatically receive such 
marketing information. However, at any time, you can opt out of receiving 
further marketing information from Comdata by emailing us at 
webmaster@comdata.com </p>

<H5>Security</H5>
<p align="justify">To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and 
ensure the correct use of information, Comdata has put in place the appropriate 
physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the 
information we collect online. </p>
<H5>Policy Changes</H5>
<p align="justify">Comdata will post changes to this policy at least 30 days 
before they take effect. Any information we collect under the current privacy 
policy will remain subject to the terms of this policy. After any changes take 
effect, all new information we collect, if any, will be subject to the new 
policy. </p>
